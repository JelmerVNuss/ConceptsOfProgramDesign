# Concepts of Program Design
A research project about C++ template metaprogramming for the course Concepts of Program Design.

The project can be divided in four parts, in which different alternatives to our problems are presented.
They are divided in the folders "DynamicTypes", "DynamicTypesMetaprogramming", "RuntimeMetaprogramming" and "TupleCsvParser".

In DynamicTypes, we created a parser for dynamic types at compile time.
In DynamicTypesMetaprogramming, we use the dynamic type parser to perform operations on the data.
In RuntimeMetaprogramming, we offer an alternative to the compile time parser to create a runtime solution.
In TupleCsvParser, we improve on the runtime solution and use a parser based on nested tuples.
